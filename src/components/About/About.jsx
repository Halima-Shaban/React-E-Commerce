          Founded in 2020 by Md Rimel, Exclusive has come a long way from its
          beginnings as a small online store. When Rimel first started, his
          passion for providing customers with high-quality yet affordable
          products drove him to do tons of research so that Exclusive can offer
          you the worldâ€™s best products at unbeatable prices.

        <p>
          We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to
          you.
